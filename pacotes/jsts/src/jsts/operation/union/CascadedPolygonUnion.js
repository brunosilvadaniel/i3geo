/**
 * Provides an efficient method of unioning a collection of
 * {@link Polygonal} geometrys.
 * This algorithm is faster and likely more robust than
 * the simple iterated approach of
 * repeatedly unioning each polygon to a result geometry.
 * <p>
 * The <tt>buffer(0)</tt> trick is sometimes faster, but can be less robust and
 * can sometimes take an exceptionally long time to complete.
 * This is particularly the case where there is a high degree of overlap
 * between the polygons.  In this case, <tt>buffer(0)</tt> is forced to compute
 * with <i>all</i> line segments from the outset,
 * whereas cascading can eliminate many segments
 * at each stage of processing.
 * The best case for buffer(0) is the trivial case
 * where there is <i>no</i> overlap between the input geometries.
 * However, this case is likely rare in practice.
