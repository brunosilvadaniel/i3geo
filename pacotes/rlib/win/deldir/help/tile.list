_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     For each point in the set being tessellated produces a list entry
     describing the Dirichlet/Voronoi tile containing that point.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      tile.list(object) 

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  object: An object of class 'deldir' as produced by the function
          'deldir()'.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list with one entry for each of the points in the set being
     tesselated.  Each entry is in turn a list with components

      pt: The coordinates of the point whose tile is being described.

       x: The 'x' coordinates of the vertices of the tile, in
          anticlockwise order.

       y: The 'y' coordinates of the vertices of the tile, in
          anticlockwise order.

      bp: Vector of logicals indicating whether the tile vertex is a
          ``real'' vertex, or a _boundary point_, i.e. a point where
          the tile edge intersects the boundary of the enclosing
          rectangle

_A_c_k_n_o_w_l_e_d_g_e_m_e_n_t:

     The author expresses sincere thanks to Majid Yazdani who found and
     pointed out a serious bug in 'tile.list' in the previous version
     (0.0-5) of the 'deldir' package.

_W_a_r_n_i_n_g:

     The set of vertices of each tile may be ``incomplete''.  Only
     vertices which lie within the enclosing rectangle, and ``boundary
     points'' are listed.

     Note that the enclosing rectangle may be specified by the user in
     the call to 'deldir()'.

     In contrast to the previous version of 'deldir', the corners of
     the enclosing rectangle are now include as vertices of tiles. 
     I.e. a tile which in fact extends beyond the rectangular window
     and contains a corner of that window will have that corner added
     to its list of vertices.  Thus when the corresponding polygon is
     plotted, the result is the intersection of the tile with the
     enclosing rectangular window.
