                           wpoints=c('both','real','dummy','none'),
                           number=FALSE,cex=1,nex=1,col=NULL,lty=NULL,

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: An object of class "deldir" as constructed by the function
          deldir. 

     add: logical argument; should the plot be added to an existing
          plot? 

  wlines: "which lines?".  I.e.  should the Delaunay triangulation be
          plotted (wlines='triang'), should the Dirichlet tessellation
          be plotted (wlines='tess'), or should both be plotted
          (wlines='both', the default) ? 

 wpoints: "which points?".  I.e.  should the real points be plotted
          (wpoints='real'), should the dummy points be plotted
          (wpoints='dummy'), should both be plotted (wpoints='both',
          the default) or should no points be plotted (wpoints='none')? 

  number: Logical argument, defaulting to 'FALSE'; if 'TRUE' then the
          points plotted will be labelled with their index numbers
          (corresponding to the row numbers of the matrix "summary" in
          the output of deldir). 

     cex: The value of the character expansion argument cex to be used
          with the plotting symbols for plotting the points. 

     nex: The value of the character expansion argument cex to be used
          by the text function when numbering the points with their
          indices.  Used only if number='TRUE'. 

     col: the colour numbers for plotting the triangulation, the
          tesselation, the data points, the dummy points, and the point
          numbers, in that order; defaults to c(1,1,1,1,1).  If fewer
          than five numbers are given, they are recycled.  (If more
          than five numbers are given, the redundant ones are ignored.) 

     lty: the line type numbers for plotting the triangulation and the
          tesselation, in that order; defaults to 1:2.  If only one
          value is given it is repeated.  (If more than two numbers are
          given, the redundant ones are ignored.) 

     pch: the plotting symbols for plotting the data points and the
          dummy points, in that order; may be either integer or
          character; defaults to 1:2.  If only one value is given it is
          repeated.  (If more than two values are given, the redundant
          ones are ignored.) 

    xlim: the limits on the x-axis.  Defaults to rw[1:2] where rw is
          the rectangular window specification returned by deldir(). 

    ylim: the limits on the y-axis.  Defaults to rw[3:4] where rw is
          the rectangular window specification returned by deldir(). 

    xlab: label for the x-axis.  Defaults to 'x'.  Ignored if
          'add=TRUE'. 

    ylab: label for the y-axis.  Defaults to 'y'.  Ignored if
          'add=TRUE'. 

     ...: Further plotting parameters to be passed to 'plot()'
          'segments()' or 'points()'.  Unlikely to be used. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The points in the set being triangulated are plotted with
     distinguishing symbols.  By default the real points are plotted as
     circles (pch=1) and the dummy points are plotted as triangles
     (pch=2).

_S_i_d_e _E_f_f_e_c_t_s:

     A plot of the points being triangulated is produced or added to an
     existing plot.  As well, the edges of the Delaunay triangles
     and/or of the Dirichlet tiles are plotted.  By default the
     triangles are plotted with solid lines (lty=1) and the tiles with
     dotted lines (lty=2).
