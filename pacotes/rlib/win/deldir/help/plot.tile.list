_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     A method for 'plot'.  Plots (sequentially) the tiles associated
     with each point in the set being tessellated.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     plot.tile.list(x, verbose = FALSE, close=FALSE, pch=1, polycol=NA,
                    showpoints=TRUE, asp=1, ...)
     ## S3 method for class 'tile.list':
     plot(x, verbose = FALSE, close=FALSE, pch=1,
                              polycol=NA, showpoints=TRUE, asp=1, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: A list of the tiles in a tessellation, as produced the
          function 'tile.list()'.

 verbose: Logical scalar; if 'TRUE' the tiles are plotted one at a time
          (with a ``Go?'' prompt after each) so that the process can be
          watched.

   close: Logical scalar; if 'TRUE' the outer edges of of the tiles
          (i.e. the edges of the enclosing rectangle) are drawn. 
          Otherwise tiles on the periphery of the tessellation are left
          ``open''.

     pch: The plotting character for plotting the points of the pattern
          which was tessellated.  Ignored if 'showpoints' is 'FALSE'.

 polycol: Optional vector of integers (or 'NA's); the i-th entry
          indicates with which colour to fill the i-th tile.  Note that
          an 'NA' indicates the use of no colour at all.

showpoints: Logical scalar; if 'TRUE' the points of the pattern which
          was tesselated are plotted.

     asp: The aspect ratio of the plot; integer scalar or 'NA'.  Set
          this argument equal to 'NA' to allow the data to determine
          the aspect ratio and hence to make the plot occupy the
          complete plotting region in both 'x' and 'y' directions. This
          is inadvisable; see the *Warnings*.

     ...: Optional arguments; not used.  There for consistency with the
          generic 'plot' function.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     NULL; side effect is a plot.

_W_a_r_n_i_n_g_s:

     The default value for 'verbose' was formerly 'TRUE'; it is now
     'FALSE'.

     The user is _strongly advised_ not to set the value of 'asp' but
     rather to leave 'asp' equal to its default value of '1'.  Any
     other value distorts the tesselation and destroys the
     perpendicular appearance of lines which are indeed perpendicular. 
     (And conversely can cause lines which are not perpendicular to
     appear as if they are.)

     The argument 'asp' is present ``just because it can be''.
