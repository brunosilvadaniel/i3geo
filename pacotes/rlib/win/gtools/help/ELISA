_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Observed signals and (for some observations) nominal
     concentrations for samples that were aliquoted to multiple assay
     plates, which were read multiple times on multiple days.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     data(ELISA)

_F_o_r_m_a_t:

     a data frame with the following columns:

   _P_l_a_t_e_D_a_y factor. Specifies one of four physically disctinct 96 well
        plates

   _R_e_a_d factor. The signal was read 3 times for each plate.

   _D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n character. Indicates contents of sample.

   _C_o_n_c_e_n_t_r_a_t_i_o_n numeric. Nominal concentration of standards (NA for
        all other samples).

   _S_i_g_n_a_l numeric. Assay signal. Specifically, optical density (a
        colorimetric assay).

_S_o_u_r_c_e:

     Anonymized data.
